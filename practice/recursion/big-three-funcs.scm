;; Whew! We've spent a solid week and a half drilling recursive design 
;; techniques over lists and the natural numbers. But this only the beginning!
;; We will deepen our knowledge of recursive design throughout the remainder
;; course as we explore more intricate and complex problems. As a starting
;; point in this conversation, we'll look at the patterns of recursion that
;; we have developed so far and how they relate to the "big three" operations
;; over lists we encountered earlier in the course.
