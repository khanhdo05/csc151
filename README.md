## Language used: Scheme/Scamper
Scheme is a dialect of the **Lisp** family of programming languages. Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT AI Lab) and released by its developers, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers (Wikipedia).
Scamper is a mini-Scheme implementation for teaching, targeting multimedia applications on the web designed by Professor Osera.
